Observations/Generalizations:

1) In general, dedicated search engines are much faster at searching a site that the site itself.  

2) Search Engines, in particular Google, offer huge value added via their service - they return far better results than native search apis. 

I wonder if (1 + 2) are self reinforcing; do sites ignore having good native search because it can be outsourced for free?  It could also be do to the difficulty of getting search right.  It is probably both.
